# carbonfootprintshallgivesalary
This is our project for Oak Codefest January 19-20 2019.
Our project is focused on the theme of transportation, with the inclusion of energy infomatics.
We came up with an idea to aid companies promote a green work space and world. We did this by making a software and hardware that can be 
installed at the gate of a company. The employee scans his/her ID card and using a scanner and using our GUI software, they input their mode
of transport, and the software checks the company database to find out their registered address and use all of that to calculate the carbon 
footprints they produce.

At the end of the month, the number of carbon footprints used per day is added up and based on their final carbon footprint at the end of 
the month, they will get a increased bonus or a decreased bonus. This will encourage healthy work atmosphere contributing towards a green
earth!
